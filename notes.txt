Lab4: Never Fear, Big O is Here!
2022-01-10

DISCO:
- Big O expresses the relation between how many elements are in the dataset and how many swaps and passes are made

QCC:
- Desmos is great at visualizing the equations
- For time complexities, we encountered O(n) and O(n^2)

BUB-QA:
* q0: If a pass requires no swaps, what do you know?
* a0: array is sorted
* q1: After pass p, what do you know?
* a1: p elements are in their final position
* q2: How many passes are necessary to completely sort?
* a2: n-1

SEL-QA:
* q0: How many passes to sort n elements?
* a0: n-1
* q1: What do you know after pass p?
* a1: last p elements are in ascending order
* q2: How do you know if sorted?
* a2: array is in ascending order
* q3: What does a pass boil down to?
* a3: locating the index of the greatest value and swapping that element with the element of the last index

INS-QA:
 * q0: How many passes to sort n elements?
 * a0: data.size()-1
 * q1: What do you know after pass p?
 * a1: first p elements are in ascending order (occupying the 'sorted region')
 * q2: How will you know when sorted?
 * a2: array is in ascending order
 * q3: What constitutes a pass?
 * a3: the program moves the first element in the unsorted region to its appropriate location in the sorted region
 * q4: What must you track?
 * a4: location of partition as it traverses through the sorted region
